# Stage Guide

- Stages should about roughly 34 rooms each in length for each path, shorter or longer depending on requirements
- Each stage should include a route for rock with a hidden rift letter collectable, and a bass route with a hidden scrap letter collectable
- Stages have gimmicks, each one should have roughly 1 - 3 gimmicks and 2 being the average norm where 3 is reserved for those like encrypt who would be befitting of being gimmick heavy
- roughly 7 - 9 enemies per stage, 8 is the norm it seems with percentile of reused enemies to unique enemies bouncing between usually having at least half unique to little less than half.
- each boss is to have a panic attack that activates at half hp, whether it'd be a repeatable move or a single one that changes the atmosphere of the arena like absolute man
