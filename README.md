Mega man & Bass Queen's Gambit, a fan game in development by Team MMQG.  

Take on the role of Mega man and defeat Queen's forces, challenging 10 new robot masters and eventually the queen herself!  

This is demo 1 which a lot of stuff is VERY early in development and highly subject to change as we continue to flesh this fan game out!
